**Period of time: from 2021 to 2022**

### 01 - INTRODUCTION
- This repository contains the datasource, an EDA SQL script, a data cleaning SQL script and an interactive Tableau workbook for visulization.

- The datasource has **307.973 rows** and **19 columns**.

- Link to the [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/huyen.phan5825/viz/RoadAccidentDashboard_16962422435460/Dashboard1)

### 02- REQUIREMENTS
- **Initial requirements**: 

Clients want to create a UK Road Crash dashboard for the years from 2021 to 2022 so that they can have the following insights with the hope that they can minimize the loss of lives.

- **KPIs**

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties, categorized into levels of accident severity, which took place after the accident per year

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties with respect to level of accident severity and total casualties by type of vehicle per year.

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type per year.

ðŸ“Œ Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the current year and the previous year.

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties by Road type.

ðŸ“Œ Distribution of total casualties by road surface.

ðŸ“Œ Relation between Casualties by Area, Location & by Day/ Night.

### 03 - TOOL USED
- **SQL Microsoft Server** for EDA and Data Cleaning Process.

- **Tableau Desktop** for Data Visualization in parallel with Data Analysis.

### 04 - STEPS
**Step 1 - Data Cleaning by Excel**

The raw csv file contained inconsistent data type within column "accident_date", which need to be fixed by using Excel.

**Step 2 - EDA using SQL**

I started with exploratory data analysis to deeper understand about the data patterns, inconsistences and potential insights. 
This step drives effective decision-making, aids in data cleaning, and informs appropriate analysis methods for enhanced project outcomes.

**Step 3 - Data Cleaning using SQL**

This step involves getting rid of data inconsistencies, errors, and duplicates, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data I'm using for subsequent analysis.

**Step 4 - Data Processing**

This step contains generating additional columns by organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to derive valuable insights.

**Step 5 - Data Analyzing and Data Visualizing**

I conducted analysis and visualization simultaneously to grasp insights quickly, validate results, communicate effectively, and refine hypotheses iteratively. It aids in comprehensive understanding and facilitates efficient data exploration and interpretation.

**Step 6 - Dashboard Building** 

Finally, I translate all the insights into an interactive Tableau Public dashboard, enabling users to engage with the data.

### 05 - Insights from SQL EDA Script (associated with each KPIs)

Note: Audience can easily find the completed EDA Script in the attached file name: **[03_UKRoadCrash_SQLQuery_DataCleaningScript.sql](https://github.com/Huyen-P/UK-Road-Crash-Analysis/blob/62e3ed5ce8652eccf505a578e57572986c1147a8/03_UKRoadCrash_SQLQuery_DataCleaningScript.sql)**

âœ…  The **Total Casualties** occurring post the accident amount to **417.883** and was categorized into 3 groups of the level of accident severity including **Slight**, **Serious** and **Fatal** with retrieved numbers are **351.436**, **59.312**,**7.135**; respectively.
