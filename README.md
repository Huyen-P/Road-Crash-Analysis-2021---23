### 02- REQUIREMENTS
**Initial requirements**: 

Clients want to create a UK Road Crash dashboard for the years from 2019 to 2022 so that they can have the following insights with the hope that they can minimize the loss of lives.

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties took place after the accident.

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.

ðŸ“Œ Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type.

ðŸ“Œ Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the current year and the previous year.

ðŸ“Œ Maximum Casualties by Road type.

ðŸ“Œ Distribution of total casualties by road surface.

ðŸ“Œ Relation between Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night.

### 03 - TOOL USED
ðŸ“Œ **SQL Microsoft Server** for EDA and Data Cleaning Process.

ðŸ“Œ **Tableau Desktop** for Data Visualization in parallel with Data Analysis.

### 04 - STEPS
**EDA**

I started with exploratory data analysis to deeper understand about the data patterns, inconsistences and potential insights. This step drives effective decision-making, aids in data cleaning, and informs appropriate analysis methods for enhanced project outcomes.

**Data Cleaning**

This step involves getting rid of data inconsistencies, errors, and duplicates, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data I'm using for subsequent analysis.

**Data Processing**

This step contains generating additional columns by organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to derive valuable insights.

**Data Analysing and Data Visualizing**

I conducted analysis and visualization simultaneously to grasp insights quickly, validate results, communicate effectively, and refine hypotheses iteratively. It aids in comprehensive understanding and facilitates efficient data exploration and interpretation.

**Dashboard Building** 

Finally, I translate all the insights into an interactive Tableau Public dashboard, enabling users to engage with the data.

### 05 - Insights from SQL query (following to the KPIs)
âœ… The **Total Casualties** occurring post the accident amount to **417883**.
